If a _User_ chooses to store any _SPI_ in the _Application_, the _User_ is responsible for complying with any regulatory controls regarding that data.

The _Application_ does not use any third-party libraries that may collect _SPI_; however, this Privacy Policy cannot speak for the Android or Google libraries.


## Security

While the information that is stored should only be visible to the _Application_, it is possible that on a modified phone, such as one that has been rooted, this may not be the case. Consequently, the _Developer_ cannot guarantee the information's absolute security.
