* Updated package versions. Because of the Room package update, this seems to
  cause crashes that, according to the Google Developer console, aren't visible
  to users, so maybe it's ok? Hopefully a later update to the Room package
  fixes this.
* Added auto-snooze feature because someone wanted it.
* Fixed exception issues from using the flashlight feature.
* Removed some unnecessary code, and updated the width/height of some Views to
  placate some accessibility warnings I was getting.
