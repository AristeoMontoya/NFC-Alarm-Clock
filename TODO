* Test upcoming alarm notification. I commented it out of the Manifest because I
  didn't know why it was in there.

* Figure out out to consolidate NacNotifications

* Figure out how to close notification activity (NacAlarmActivity) from the
  notification. The action just calls the NacForegroundService, but if the
  NacAlarmActivity is in the foreground, it will not be closed.

* Change to the androix MediaPlayer
