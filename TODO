* Clicking on NFC button was closing the dialog and acting as if I clicked it.

* Can maybe do a rings thing, full rings, and pulse it like drops of water

* Fix the AM/PM text in the alarm activity time

* Figure out why I use home in NacFile

* Reorganize some of the packages like media. See if I can make a media player package?

* Have option to scroll alarm name instead of marquee it
