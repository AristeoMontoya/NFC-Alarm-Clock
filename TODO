* Investigate how day abbreviation is being done and change it so that they
  are in string resources instead. Vietnamese and probably Creole do it differently
  than English so need to account for that.

* Add recursive ls() for playing all music in folders and, when this is done,
  playing music in subfolders as well.

* Add option in Statistics to export to csv.

* Add option to change step time when gradually increasing volume.

* Early notification in alarm options
	- have an incremental countdown to alarm

* Reorganize some of the packages like media. See if I can make a media player package?

* Have option to scroll alarm name instead of marquee it

Issues
------

* The alarm was resized/colored incorrectly, I believe after the media activity.
