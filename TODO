* Fix how Created statistics are saving the name, hour, and minute of an alarm,
  but these never get set.

* Update the Statistic fragment so that the error toast is not only in English.

* Early notification in alarm options
	- have an incremental countdown to alarm

* Reorganize some of the packages like media. See if I can make a media player package?

* Have option to scroll alarm name instead of marquee it

Issues
------

* The alarm was resized/colored incorrectly, I believe after the media activity.
