TODO
----

* Reorganize some of the packages like media. See if I can make a media player package?

* There are a lot of classes like NacTextToSpeech that have a lot of setting an
  object to null when cleaning up, and conversely, checking if it's null and
  setting up.

* Implement Spotify

* See if I can save views to the tree. That way I can save views and easily reshow them to users

* Have option to scroll alarm name instead of marquee it

* Change AppCompatActivity to one that can use Material theme

* Remove the following? isInUse, checkCanBeModified, checkCanBeDeleted

------
Issues
