* Save stream usage as an int in the database, instead of a string.

* Can get rid of NacDatabaseBackgroundService.

* Can use NacAlarm.Builder in NacDatabase.toAlarm.

* Figure out how to close notification activity (NacAlarmActivity) from the
  notification. The action just calls the NacForegroundService, but if the
  NacAlarmActivity is in the foreground, it will not be closed.


* Change to the androix MediaPlayer
