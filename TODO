* Mention open-source and/or permissions in screenshots?

* Add privacy policy to app in app store.

* Add language translations.

* Figure out out to consolidate NacNotifications

* Figure out how to close notification activity (NacAlarmActivity) from the
  notification. The action just calls the NacForegroundService, but if the
  NacAlarmActivity is in the foreground, it will not be closed.

* Change to the androix MediaPlayer
